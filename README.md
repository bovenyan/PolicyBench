## Objective
Generate set of OpenFlow rules that reflects current policies of Modern enterprise networks and data center networks.

## Motivation

Enterprise networks are governed by network policies[1]. Network operators compose these policies through rules. Modern enterprise networks and data center networks are evolving and they impose a variety of constraints on point-to-point network communication[1]. In addition, due to increasing use of Network functions e.g., Distributed firewalls, Load balancer, Intrusion prevention system (IPS) in modern network, these polcies are being enormously complex. They may need rules with chaining in actions (e.g. load balance -> firewall -> IPS), wildcard rules, additional matching fields (e.g., MPLS labels).

For the simulations purpose in most  research works, Conventional ClassBench is being used to reflect the policies of Enterprise Networks. However, Conventional ClassBench rules are exact rules and they are based on the 5 tuples matching fields[2]. Moreover, the rules can not support chaining in actions. Therefore, rules generated by Conventional ClassBench may not reflect the Current Policies of Modern Enterprise Networks & Data center Networks. This bottleneck becomes a motivation behind the SDN RuleSetGenerator.

##Introduction

SDN RuleSetGenerator tool is divided into 2 separate tools: PolicyGenerator and RuleGenerator. From the characteristics of modern enterprise networks, PolicyGenerator generates variety of complex policies such as reachability, measurement and security policies. RuleGenerator uses Pyretic run-time to compile these policies and composes OpenFlow rules on the Switch.

PolicyGenerator module has three python scripts that can be executed on command line to generate policies: 
- generateReachabilityPolicies - It generates reachability policies for each host in the network. Each host belongs to 1 reachability policy unit in the network. 
- generateMeasurementPolicies - By executing this script, one can generate measurement policies.
- generate_OverlapPolicies - It generates overlapped reachibility and measurement policies. 

In pyretic submodule, 3 pyretic applications that generates OpenFlow rules and installs the rules via pyretic run-time engine.
- OverlappingPoliciesToRules -

##Installation

To install and run the tool, you need to have linux machine. 
First, fork and clone the repository in your machine through:
