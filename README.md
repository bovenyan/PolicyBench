Introduction
------------

YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine for
[Vim][]. It has several completion engines: an identifier-based engine that
works with every programming language, a semantic, [Clang][]-based engine that
provides native semantic code completion for C/C++/Objective-C/Objective-C++
(from now on referred to as "the C-family languages"), a [Jedi][]-based
completion engine for Python, an [OmniSharp][]-based completion engine for C#,
a [Gocode][]-based completion engine for Go, and an omnifunc-based completer
that uses data from Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions

# SDN_RuleSetGenerator
