## Objective
------------
Generate set of OpenFlow rules that reflects current policies of Modern enterprise networks and data center networks.

## Motivation
-------------
Enterprise networks are governed by network policies[1]. 
Rules generated by Conventional ClassBench may not reflect the Current Policies of todayâ€™s enterprise networks & Data center networks.

Desirable features required to reflect that policies are:
Wildcard rule sets 
    (10.1.* can connect to 10.2.*)
Chaining. E.g., Network  function
     chaining, service chaining
     e.g., load balance => firewall =>          	  IPS
Additional matching fields. e.g., MPLS label
 Multiple actions (fwd => count)
