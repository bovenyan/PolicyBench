## Objective
Generate set of OpenFlow rules that reflects current policies of Modern enterprise networks and data center networks.

## Motivation
Enterprise networks are governed by network policies[1]. Network operators compose these policies through rules. For the simulations purpose in most  research works, Conventional ClassBench is being used to refelct the policies of Enterprise Networks.

However, Modern enterprise networks and data center networks are evolving and they impose a variety of constraints on point-to-point network communication[1]. In addition to that, due to increasing use of Network functions e.g., Distributed firewalls, Load balancer, Intrusion prevention system (IPS) in modern network, this polcies are being enormously complex. These policies may need rules with chaining in actions (e.g. load balance -> firewall -> IPS), wildcard rules, additional matching fields (e.g., MPLS labels).

Conventional ClassBench rules are exact rules and they are based on the 5 tuples matching fields[2]. Moreover, tRules generated by Conventional ClassBench may not reflect the Current Policies of Modern Enterprise Networks & Data center Networks. 

Desirable features required to reflect that policies are:
Wildcard rule sets 
    (10.1.* can connect to 10.2.*)
Chaining. E.g., Network  function
     chaining, service chaining
     e.g., load balance => firewall =>          	  IPS
Additional matching fields. e.g., MPLS label
 Multiple actions (fwd => count)
